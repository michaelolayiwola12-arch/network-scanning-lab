# Network Scanning & Enumeration Lab

# Overview

This project documents a hands-on network reconnaissance lab conducted within a controlled environment (192.168.0.0/24).

The objective was to:

Identify active hosts

Enumerate open ports

Detect running services

Compare multiple scanning tools

# Tools Used

Angry IP Scanner

Metasploit Framework (msfconsole)

MegaPing

NetScan Tools Pro

📊 Network Scope
192.168.0.0/24

# Key Findings

7 active hosts discovered

Multiple exposed services including:

FTP (21)

SSH (22)

Telnet (23)

SMTP (25)

HTTP (80)

Metasploitable machine identified with large attack surface
